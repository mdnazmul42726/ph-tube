                        <li>var: Variables declared with var have function scope. This is the default scope

                        <li>let: Variables declared with let have block scope.</li>

                        <li>To represent an empty value. For example, you could use the null value to
                            represent an empty string or an empty array.</li>
                        <li> To indicate that a value is not available. For example, you could use the undefined value
                            to
                            indicate that a variable has not been initialized yet.</li>
                        <li> To check for the absence of a value. You can use the === operator to check if a variable is
                            equal to null or undefined.</li>

                    What do you mean by REST API?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>
                        <li>Resource identification: Each resource in a REST API is identified by a unique
                            URI.</li>
                        <li> Resource manipulation: Resources can be manipulated using four HTTP methods: GET, POST,
                            PUT, and
                            DELETE.</li>
                        <li> Self-descriptive messages: The meaning of each message is conveyed by the URI and the HTTP
                            method used.</li>
                        <li> Uniform interface: All resources are accessed using the same uniform interface.</li>
                        <li> Stateless: The client and the server should not maintain any state between requests.</li>
                        REST APIs are often used to access data from web services. They are also used to build complex
                        applications that can interact with each other. <br>

                        Here are some examples of REST APIs:

                        <li> The GitHub API allows you to access information about GitHub repositories, users, and
                            organizations.</li>
                        <li> The Google Maps API allows you to retrieve maps, directions, and other location-based
                            information.</li>
                        <li>The Stripe API allows you to process payments and manage customer accounts.</li>
                        REST APIs are a popular choice for building APIs because they are simple to understand and
                        implement. They are also scalable and efficient, making them well-suited for large-scale
                        applications.
